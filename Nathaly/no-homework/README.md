# Â¿ABOUT ME?
Hello! My name is Diana, I am from Ecuador, I love nature, a lover of animals, especially dogs and cats. In my free time I practice contemporary dance, sing and I'm learning to play the guitar, which is a big challenge because I have small hands and sometimes I don't advance the chords.
## GOALS 

- My big challenge this year and next year is learning to program in python.
- Follow my master's degree in Big Data and Data Science.

## How am I going to achieve my goals?
The Phytonian course allows us to acquire the necessary skills to manage the program, which will be held every Saturday. We have a great teacher!

## My compromise
To become an expert in the use of python, attend all the classes and do the no-homework.
